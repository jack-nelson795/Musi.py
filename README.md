# MusiPy
Converts Musi playlist to Spotify playlist.

This Python script converts a playlist from the Musi app to a local python based Musi clone app. It fetches songs from a given Musi playlist link, searches for the corresponding tracks on Spotify, and saves them, reacreating your playlist with the same songs in the same order locally, and with all the same features like playing in order and shuffle. It also logs any songs that could not be found on Spotify.
